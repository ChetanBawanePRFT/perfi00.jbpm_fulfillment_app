# Extensibility Use Cases

* [In a BPM workflow, call another REST service synchronously](#in-a-bpm-workflow-call-another-rest-service-synchronously)
* [In a BPM workflow, call another REST service asynchronously](#in-a-bpm-workflow-call-another-rest-service-asynchronously)
* [In a BPM workflow, signal to advance when stopped at a user task](#in-a-bpm-workflow-signal-to-advance-when-stopped-at-a-user-task)

## In a BPM workflow, call another REST service synchronously
This use case will illustrate how to use REST service response data to make flow decisions and provide input to subsequent steps in the process.

## In a BPM workflow, call another REST service asynchronously
This use case will illustrate how to use REST service response data to make flow decisions and provide input to other steps in the process.

## In a BPM workflow, signal to advance when stopped at a user task
This use case will illustrate how to move a process to the next step when stopped at a human user task using an external signal.
